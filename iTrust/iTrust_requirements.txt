1 Introduction.
This project involves the development of an application through which doctors can obtain and share essential patient information and can view aggregate patient data. Currently, access to a patient's history regarding previous medical problems, previous surgery, medications, allergies and other factors is often difficult or obtainable only from a patient's recollection. Now, as more hospitals and doctor's offices are automated, this information is available electronically. However, it is not accessible by other doctors, and is often only viewed through some proprietary software so it can not be shared.
The final product is a site where health care workers can access important patient information, the non-emergency access can be controlled, and all access would be tracked. Security and privacy of such a system is of paramount importance. HIPAA rules protect patients' information and also allow a patient to dictate who can access this information.
2 Glossary.
Approved diagnostic information: The set of diagnostic information a patient allows a designated or other licensed health care professional to view. A patient is only given the choice to restrict viewing on selected diagnostic information, such as those related to mental illness, substance abuse, and cosmetic surgery. The licensed health care professional making a diagnosis determines if a patient is granted the ability to restrict viewing of the diagnosis. For the diagnostic information which a patient can restrict viewing, he or she can choose to enable designated licensed health care professionals, and/or other licensed health care professionals, and/or no one.
There are ten roles in the iTrust Medical Records system. The role of a user determines their viewing and editing capabilities (role-based access control).
Health Care Personnel (HCP): All of designated licensed health care professionals, licensed health care professionals, and unlicensed authorized personnel, as defined below.
Patient: When an American infant is born or a foreigner requests medical care, each is assigned a medical identification number and password. Then, this person's electronic records are accessible via the iTrust Medical Records system.
Administrator: The administrator assigns medical identification numbers and passwords to LHCPs. [Note: for simplicity of the project, an administrator is added by directly entering the administrator into the database by an administrator that has access to the database.].
Licensed Health Care Professional (LHCP): A licensed health care professional that is allowed by a particular patient to view all approved medical records. In general, a patient does not know this non-designated health care professional, such as an emergency room doctor, and the set of approved records may be smaller than that granted to a designated licensed health care professional.
Designated Licensed Health Care Professional (DLHCP): A licensed health care professional that is allowed by a particular patient to view all approved medical records. Any LHCP can be a DLHCP to some patients (with whom he/she has an established relationship) and an LHCP to others (whom he/she has never/rarely seen before).
Emergency Responder (ER): Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), and other medically trained emergency responders who provide care while at, or in transport from, the site of an emergency. [referred to as "on site care providers" by Department of Health and Human Services Emergency Responder Electronic Health Record Use Case Department of Health and Human Services.
Unlicensed Authorized Personnel (UAP): A health care worker such as a medical secretary, case manager, care coordinator, or other authorized clerical-type personnel. An unlicensed personnel can enter and edit demographic information, diagnosis, office visit notes and other medical information, and can view records.
Software Tester: An information technology worker who tests the iTrust Medical Records system. Of particular interest to the software tester is the operational profile information which informs him/her of the frequency of use of the features of the system.
Personal Representative: A person legally authorized to make health care decisions on an individual's behalf or to act for a deceased individual. When a person logs into iTrust, if he or she is a personal representative, they view their own records or those of the person/people they are representing. (For example, a mother could choose herself and any one of her children.).
Public Health Agent: A person legally authorized view and respond to reports of adverse events.
Lab Technician (LT): A clinical worker that runs diagnostic tests on samples gathered from patients during office visits. The lab technician can specialize in blood work, tissue work, or general.
These are the standards codes used within iTrust:
ICD-9CM: The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (most commonly known by the abbreviation ICD) provides codes to classify diseases and a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease. NHCS Classification of Diseases, Functioning and Disability.
ND: The National Drug Code (NDC) is a universal product identifier used in the United States for drugs intended for human use. National Drug Code Directory.
LOINC: Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) is a database and universal standard for identifying medical laboratory observations.LOINC c/o Medical Informatics.
CPT: The CPT code set accurately describes medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians, coders, patients, accreditation organizations, and payers for administrative, financial, and analytical purposes.About CPT.
ORC: The override reason code. A set of reasons for ignoring a reaction warning and prescribing a medication anyways. Override Reason Codes.

3 Functional Requirements.
3.1. Use Case Diagram and Flow of Events.
There are 45  Use Cases for the system, as indicated by the attached diagram: .
 .
Throughout this document MID = medical identification number. The MID is a unique number assigned to all roles.
3.2. Use Case Descriptions.
The following use cases have been retired: 7, 14,20, 39,41.
The following use cases document flows of events.
3.2.1 UC1 Create and Disable Patients Use Case.
3.2.1.1 Preconditions.
The iTrust HCP has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC3).
3.2.1.2 Main Flow.
An HCP is able to create a patient [S1] or disable a selected patient [S2]. The create/disable patients and HCP transaction is logged (UC5).
3.2.1.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] The HCP enters a patient as a new user of iTrust Medical Records system. Only the name and email are provided. The patient's assigned MID and a secret key (the initial password) are personally provided to the user, with which the user can reset his/her password. The HCP can edit the patient according to data format 6.4 [E1] with all initial values (except patient MID) defaulting to null and/or 0 as appropriate. Patient MID should be the number assigned when the patient is added to the system and cannot be edited. The HCP does not have the ability to enter/edit/view the patient's security question/password.
[S2] The HCP selects a patient to deactivate. The HCP is presented with a confirmation containing the name of the patient and determines if it is the patient they intend to deactivate [E2]. A deactivated patient can not be modified or log into the system, and can only be reactivated by the administrator.
[S3] The HCP uploads a comma-seperated value file containing one patient per row. The fields of the CSV file must include at least the first name, last name, and e-mail address, with additional columns available for the other demographic values. The patients are created, the tables are populated, and the MIDS and temporary passwords are displayed to the HCP in a table. The event is logged.
3.2.1.4 Alternative Flows.
[E1] The system prompts the enterer/editor to correct the format of a required data field because the input of that data field does not match that specified in data format 6.4 for patients.
[E2] If the confirmation screen does not show the name of the intended patient, the HCP is then prompted to input the correct patient identification information again.
[E3] If the file is malformed, then no data is added, and an error message explaining the correct file structure is presented.
3.2.1.5 Logging.
3.2.1.6 Example CSV File.
  lastName,firstName,email,phone.
  Peddycord,Barry,barry@itrust.org,555-555-5555.
  Kim,Donghoon,donghoon@itrust.org,555-555-5555.
  King,Jason,jason@itrust.org,555-555-5555.
Anything that is a valid field in data format 6.4 should be accepted as a column.
Acceptable header fields currently includes:
  lastName,firstName,email,streetAddress1,streetAddress2,city,state,zip,phone,motherMID,fatherMID,creditCardType,creditCardNumber.

3.2.2.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] An administrator enters a LHCP, ER, or public health agent as a user of iTrust Medical Records system, initially only the name and email are provided. A secret key is personally provided to the user, with which the user can reset his/her password. The admin must specify a specialty for a new LHCP (general physician, heart surgeon, OB-GYN, pediatrician, surgeon) and for a new LT ( blood, tissue, or general). The data for personnel can be edited according to Data Format 6.2 (all fields mandatory except for associated MID and Street Address 2) [S6, E1]. The administrator shall be allowed to assign a LHCP to multiple hospitals, and the administrator can choose among only the hospitals provided in the hospital list pull down menu. The hospital ID numbers for a LHCP are stored in the Medical Care Personnel Affiliation database (data format 6.8). The administrator shall be allowed to assign a LT to a single hospital, and the administrator can choose among only the hospitals provided in the hospital list pull down menu. The hospital ID numbers for a LT are stored in the Medical Care Personnel Affiliation database (data format 6.11).
[S2] A LHCP enters an UAP as a user of iTrust Medical Records system according to data format 6.2 (all fields mandatory) [E1].
3.2.2.4 Alternative Flows.

To do so, a user selects one option out of the "Sort by" labeled drop-down box (with options of "Sender/Recipient" or "Timestamp") and selects one option out of the "by order of" labeled drop-down box (with options of "ascending" or "descending"), and then click the "Sort" button. Note that the sorted order is not saved for later viewing after the message inbox or outbox is reopened again (where the default sorting is always used).
[S7] A user (an LHCP or patient/representative) can modify his/her message displaying filter by modifying the following filtering criteria: (1) the sender (i.e., the sender's name is exactly the same as the specified string). (2) the subject (i.e., the subject is exactly the same as the specified string). (3) has the words (i.e., the subject or the message body has the specified substring). (4) doesn't have specified words (i.e., neither the subject nor the message body has the specified substring). (5) time stamp falling into the period defined by the starting date and ending date (inclusive) (the user interface shall provide both the option of typing in a specific date in the date format and the option of selecting a date from a calendar for the current month). Note that a single filter includes values for these five filtering criteria (rather than five filters for these five filtering criteria) and a value could be an empty string, indicating that this criterion has no impact on filtering (i.e., imposing no constraints related to this criterion). The user interface shall be initially populated with the values of the filtering criteria from the previously saved filter. After the user modifies the criteria, the user chooses to click the "Cancel" button to cancel the modifications of the filter (i.e., repopulate the user interface with the values of the filtering criteria from the previously saved filter), to click the "Test Search" button to search (i.e., displaying the message inbox [S5] including only the messages satisfying the specified filtering criteria), or to click the "Save" button to save the modified filter. Each user is associated with only one filter (being saved across login sessions) and applies only this saved filter. The user's associated filter initially has all empty inputs for the filtering criteria before the user modifies it.

3.2.31 UC31 Find LHCPs for prescription renewal Use Case.
3.2.31.1 Preconditions.
The iTrust user (patient) has been authenticated in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC3).
3.2.31.2 Main Flow.
A patient wants to renew the patient's expired prescriptions (i.e., prescriptions' end dates are earlier than the current date) and therefore wants to find the LHCPs who earlier wrote the patient's expired prescriptions (it is assumed that the doctors who wrote prescriptions are all LHCPs so no LHCP checks on the prescription-writing doctors are needed). The patient chooses "My Expired Prescription Reports" and is presented with a list of the patient's expired prescriptions [S1], sorted by start date (the later date is ranked earlier closer to the top). The patient can select to view contact information of a selected LHCP shown in the expired prescription list [S2].
3.2.31.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] The expired prescription report list is titled with the patient name. The expired prescription list includes medication, date prescribed (i.e., the day of the office visit), start date, end date for each prescription, and the name of the LHCP who prescribed the medication (where the name of the LHCP is linked to contact information for that LHCP). If there are no expired prescriptions, an empty expired prescription list is presented.
[S2] The patient clicks on the name of the LHCP for an expired prescription, and is presented with the contact information for that LHCP (including First Name Last Name, LHCP Type, Street Address 1, Street Address 2, City, State, Zip Code, Phone, and Contact Email); if any type of contact information is missing or the whole contact information for the LHCP is not available in the database, the corresponding missing types of information are simply shown as blank.

3.2.32.1 Preconditions.
The HCP has authenticated himself or herself in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC2),(UC3).
3.2.32.2 Main Flow.
The HCP chooses "Potential Prescription-Renewals" and is presented with a list of patients [S2] that satisfy all of the three conditions: (1) patients for whom the HCP is a DLHCP, (2) special-diagnosis-history patients [S1], (3) patients whose prescriptions will expire within 7 days (including the 7th day) from the current date.
3.2.32.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] A chronic special-diagnosis-history patient is an alive patient who has been diagnosed with at least one of the following:
* diabetes mellitus (is diagnosed with ICD code beginning with 250),.
* asthma (is diagnosed with ICD code beginning with 493), or.
* circulatory-system disease (is diagnosed with an ICD code between 390 and 459 inclusive).
[S2] The patient list is titled with the HCP's name. The patient list includes the patient's name (i.e., first name and last name), phone number, and contact email address [E1, E2] (so that confirmation calls or emails can be made or sent outside of the iTrust system). The list is sorted based on the ascending alphabetical order of the patients' last names, and then first names. When a chronic special-diagnosis-history patient satisfies all three conditions and has multiple prescriptions satisfying the third condition, the patient is listed in the list only once. The list is a static list with no link on the patient's name, phone number, or contact email address).

3.2.33.1 Preconditions.
The iTrust user (patient or HCP) has been authenticated in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC3).
3.2.33.2 Main Flow.
A sending HCP refers the patient to another receiving HCP [S1]. A receiving HCP views a list of received referrals [S2]. A sending HCP views a list of previously sent patient referrals [S3]. A patient views the details of his/her referrals [S4]. A sending HCP edits a previously sent patient referral [S5]. A sending HCP cancels a previously sent patient referral [S6]. All events are logged (UC5).
3.2.33.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] An HCP chooses to refer a patient to another receiving HCP through the referral feature on a patient's office visit page (UC11). The sending HCP must select a receiving HCP by either entering the HCP's MID and confirming the selection, or by searching for the HCP by name. The sending HCP is also presented with a text box to include notes about the referral. The sending HCP then chooses a priority from 1-3 (1 is most important, 3 is least important) for the referral. The HCP may send the referral, cancel the referral [E1], or edit the referral [E2]. Upon sending a referral, the patient, sending HCP, and receiving HCP receive a message summarizing the newly created referral information (sending HCP name & specialty, receiving HCP name & specialty, patient name, referral notes, and referral creation timestamp); additionally, the sending and receiving HCP messages include the referral priority.
[S2] An HCP chooses to view received referrals. The receiving HCP is presented with a list of referrals sorted by priority (from most important to least important). The receiving HCP then selects a referral to view details and is presented with the name and specialty of the sending HCP, the patient's name, the referral notes, the referral priority, the office visit date with a link to the office visit, and the time the referral was created.
[S3] A sending HCP views a list of previously sent patient referrals. The HCP may sort the list of referrals by patient name, receiving HCP name, time generated, and/or priority. The HCP chooses a specific referral from the list to view complete details about the referral: patient name, receiving HCP name and specialty, time generated, priority, office visit date, and notes.
[S4] A patient views a list of his/her referrals. The patient may sort the list of referrals by receiving HCP name, time generated, and/or priority. The patient chooses a specific referral from the list to view complete details about the referral: sending HCP name and specialty, receiving HCP name and specialty, time generated, priority, office visit date, and notes. The patient is also provided with the option to send a message to the receiving HCP to request that an appointment be scheduled.
[S5] A sending HCP edits a previously created patient referral as long as the referral has not been viewed by the receiving HCP. The sending HCP may edit the priority of the referral and/or the referral notes. The sending HCP then chooses to save the edits, cancel the edits, or re-enter the data [E2].
[S6] A sending HCP cancels a previously sent patient referral by visiting the office visit page, viewing the details of a previously sent patient referral [S3], and choosing cancel. The HCP is asked to confirm the decision to cancel the referral. The patient and receiving HCP receive a message (UC30) indicating that the referral was canceled.
3.2.33.4 Alternate Flows.
[E1] The receiving HCP chosen is not the desired HCP. The sending HCP does not confirm the selection and is prompted to try again.

3.2.34 UC34 Report Telemedicine Monitoring Details Use Case.
3.2.34.1 Preconditions.
The iTrust user (LHCP, UAP, or patient) has been authenticated in the iTrust Medical Records system (UC3).
3.2.34.2 Main Flow.
An LHCP or UAP creates a list of patients (by MID) for which he or she will monitor remotely [E1, S1]. A patient either chooses to input his or her physiologic measurements (blood pressure and/or glucose levels) [S2], or to input his or her weight, height, and/or pedometer readings [S7]. An LHCP can see the blood pressure and glucose levels [S3], or weight, height, and pedometer readings [S8] for the patients he or she is monitoring, with two separate lists for physiologic andheight/weight/pedometer readings [S3]. A UAP [S5 & S9] or patient representative [S6 & S10] can input the blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, or pedometer readings for a patient. A patient may have up to 10 physiologic data points in any one day, reported by him/herself, a UAP, or a personal representative [E4]. A patient may have at most one height data point, one weight data point, and one pedometer data point in any one day, reported by him/herself, a UAP, or a personal representative [E6].
3.2.34.3 Sub-flows.
[S1] An LHCP or UAP can add and delete patients from his or her monitoring list. A patient is added to the list by the LHCP or UAP typing in the patient's MID [E1] or name. An LHCP can delete a patient from his or her monitoring list by the LHCP typing the the patient's MID [E1]. In both cases, the LHCP is presented the name of the patient and must confirm the add/delete. For each patient from the monitoring list, the LHCP can choose to edit which types of remote monitoring information (blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, and pedometer readings) should be submitted by the patient. By default, all types of information are selected for monitoring.
[S2] A patient whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring chooses to report their physiologic data. He or she can report his or her blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3]. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact that the status is "self-reported" are saved.
[S3] An LHCP chooses to view the physiologic data monitoring details. The LHCP is presented with a listing of all his or her patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring with their blood pressure and glucose levels, recording timestamp, and whom reported the data (patient, UAP name, personal representative name). Patients with no information for the current day are highlighted. Patients with blood pressure or glucose level out of range are highlighted (normal blood pressure: systolic 90-140; diastolic 60-90; normal glucose 70-150). The LHCP can select a patient to obtain additional information about a patient [S4].
[S4] An LHCP selects to view additional information for a patient. The LHCP is presented with a screen upon which he/she can choose a date range. Once the date range is selected, the LHCP can see the patient name; patient phone number; personal representative (name and phone number), if applicable; and the blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, and pedometer readings as well as whom reported the data (patient, UAP name, personal representative name) for that date range.
[S5] A UAP can select to report physiologic measurements. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for whom he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact that the status was reported by "case manager" and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the UAP.
[S6] A patient can select to report physiologic measurements for those whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring andfor whom he/she is a patient representative. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for which he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data and a timestamp and the fact that the status was reported by "patient representative" and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the patient.
[S7] A patient whose height, weight, or pedometer data type is specified to be under monitoring chooses to report his/her height/weight/pedometer data. He or she can report his or her daily height (in the format of digits XXXX.X with the units of "feet"), daily weight (in the format of digits XXXX.X with units of "lbs"), and/or pedometer readings (in the format of up to 10 digits of integer with units of "footsteps") [E5]. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact that the status is "self-reported" are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the patient.
[S8] An LHCP chooses to view the height/weight/pedometer data monitoring details. The LHCP is presented with a listing of all his or her patients whose height, weight, or pedometer data type is specified to be under monitoring with their height, weight and pedometer reading numbers, recording timestamp, and who reported the data (patient name, UAP name, or personal representative name). Patients with no information for the current day are highlighted in red. Patients with a weight value 5% more or less than the immediate previously recorded weight value are highlighted (if the new weight value exceeds 105% of the previous weight value, the entry should be highlighted yellow; if the new weight value is below 95% of the previous weight value, the entry should be highlighted yellow). The LHCP can select a patient to obtain additional information about a patient [S4].
[S9] A UAP can select to report height/weight/pedometer measurements. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose height, weight, or pedometer data type is specified to be under monitoring and for which he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the height, weight, and/or pedometer reading [E5] for the patient. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact that the status was reported by "case manager" and his/her MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the UAP.
[S10] A patient can select to report height, weight, and/or pedometer readings for those for whom he/she is a patient representative. He/she is presented with a list of the patients for which he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the height, weight, and/or pedometer readings [E5] for the patient.
